The 'puppeteer' player controls the 'puppet' player through the use of the 4 directional buttons and changes the little floating cube that follows the player using the three buttons on the ground. The puppet player can look around and click but cannot move. The cube floating will also display the amount of orbs the player has collected and keep track during the game.

The player can only collect orbs that share the same colour as their floating orb so they must have the other player change to their correct colour. Said player can notify the other player that a change is needed by clicking on the floating cube. This changes the colour on the controller's side to visually show this need.

Once the player reaches the end of the hallway, they can either choose to let both players win the game or just they themselves. Once chosen, a text box will appear with their selected choice and they cannot select the other choice given.


This was actually quite fun once I learned and understood what I needed to do. Previously I had a little trouble with websockets and understanding how they worked/needed to be used but after getting past that hurdle, it was easy to get the idea I wanted to express coded. Wish I hadn't needed to ask for extra time but I'm glad I did. This is a much better result than the initial submission!
